#  Fake News Detection with LSTM

This project uses **Deep Learning (LSTM)** to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**.

##  Model Architecture
- **Embedding Layer** → Converts words into dense vectors  
- **LSTM Layer** → Captures sequential patterns in text  
- **Dense Layer (Sigmoid)** → Outputs probability (0 = Fake, 1 = Real)
